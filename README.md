# Computer Vision

The data set for the project is a sample from Stallkamp et al's German Street Sign Recognition
Benchmark. Originally the data set consisted of 39,209 RGB-coloured train and 12,630 RGB-coloured
test images of different sizes displaying 43 different types of German traffic signs. These images are not
centred and are taken during different times of the day. 

In this project, different supervised and unsupervised machine learning models are used to classify images. Also, different deep learning models such as ANN and CNN are used for classification.
